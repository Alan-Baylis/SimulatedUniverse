My project is a 3D simulated universe, which is developed with Unity. 
The primary aim of my project is to offer an interactive, interesting and educational game-like environment.
The project generates an approximation of our relative universe from a dataset of celestial objects, these objects are then rendered using Unity.
The simulated environment allows the user to navigate the universe at various scales, providing a glimpse of the raw size and vastness of the universe we live in.

Here is a working example: http://i.imgur.com/aEiG6if.gifv
